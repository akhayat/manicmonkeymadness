=Introduction=

Because of it's novelty, documentation for the <audio> tag in HTML5 is scarce, but I was able to scrape enough from google to use it to come up with a way of doing sound effects without having to use any flash. This wiki tells a little bit about how sound is done in our project, and more importantly, how to add and reference your own sound effects to the code. 

=How to Add a Sound to M3=

Instead of flooding our index.html file with a lot of <audio src=..., I used the Audio() object in javascript, which is essentially the same concept.  Now, any new sounds can be easily added to m3 in almost the same way as images.

Like images, sounds are added through in assets.js, through a hidden method that takes a source and a boolean that tells it whether to loop or not.  You can call like this:

{{{ monkeys: soundFromSource("music/monkeys", true)}}}

The file extension should either be .ogg, or .mp3.  If you want the sound to be able to play in all major browsers, you should include both. _Don't include the file extension in the string containing the source_.  The soundFromSource automatically adds the .ogg or .mp3 extension, depending on the browser.  For example, I included a monkeys.ogg AND a monkeys.mp3. So in the code above, if the browser is capable of playing ogg's, it will add the .ogg extension, otherwise it will add an .mp3 one.  If the browser plays neither, the sound wont play.

*Careful.*  If you type the extension incorrectly, there won't be any error in the console, the sound simply won't play.
