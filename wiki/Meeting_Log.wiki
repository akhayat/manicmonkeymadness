  * Short tour of [http://chromeexperiments.com Chrome Experiments].
  * Possible projects based on: [http://www.addictinggames.com/redremover.html Red Remover], [http://www.rovio.com/index.php?page=angry-birds Angry Birds], and [http://www.addictinggames.com/crushthecastle.html Crush the Castle].
  * Watched Dan Pink's video on intrinsic motivation from Jeff Atwood's [http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ Coding Horror] website.
  * *Homework*: Find out what a _standup_ is, and how they should be conducted.

== September 2 ==
  * Reviewed course notes on [http://www.cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/computing/ computing].
  * Long discussion on possible projects, with help from Dr. Dionisio.
  * Decided on game type: strategic, physics-based game, monkeys.
  * Discussed possible game names.

== September 7 ==
  * Figured out how to sign up and create a project in Google Code.
  * Decided on a name for the game and created the summary.
  * Created Google Code project for Manic Monkey Madness (m3).
  * Determined that naming was difficult.
  * Quick peek at [http://code.google.com/p/playserengeti/ Serengeti] project for what to expect.
  * *Homework*: Tour the playserengeti wiki.

== September 9 ==
  * Began requirements analysis for manicmonkeymadness.
  * Produced high-level requirements.
  * Discussed possible strategies for iterative design and construction.
  * Discussed layered architectures: clients, web servers, backend service layers.
  * Covered XML and JSON.
  * All students set up their workstations with subversion plugins for their IDEs, checked out the project from Google Code, and performed checkins.
  * *Homework*: get familiar with canvas.

== September 14 ==
  * Standup
    * Discussed Canvas tutorials that were studied over the weekend
    * Looked at one !JavaScript physics engine
  * Assigned tasks for next class
    * Creation of background images and sprites (Matt)
    * Money sprite initial animation (David)
    * Launcher structure and behavior with good UI techniques (Anthony)
    * Physics engine research and rough fortress collapse demo (Matt and Jarod)
  * *Lecture*: !JavaScript objects, constructors, prototypes, information hiding, and anonymous functions.

== September 16 ==
  * Standup
    * Tasks completed: basic architecture, game and menu states, console with logging, rudimentary UI for slingshot launcher, initial background.
    * Tasks planned for next class: physics engine demo, launcher "class", bouncing monkey on game canvas, mostly-functional menu.
  * Sketched some ideas for a variety of monkey launchers (slingshots, canons, teeter-totters)
  * Decided on a virtual canvas size of 2000 x 450, with 900 x 450 visible.
  * Discussion on module structure for the project: should all modules follow the anonymous function call pattern, even when there is no private state?  Tradeoff is between consistency and performance.  Since the functions would be called only once, performance is a non-issue.
  * Reminded students to actively use the wiki.  All ideas, all background research, all problems, all decisions, etc. need to be documented.

  * User feedback also identified treasure as being somewhat important

== October 12 ==

  * Standup
    * Completed: 
      * Contact listener, taking into account materials, projectiles, impact velocity, damage computation, etc.
      * Scoring -- points awarded for damage, etc.  
      * Better internal implementation of pieces (and the fortress they belong to), and callbacks.
      * Monkeys are now physical objects
      * Added new class of monkeys -- the watermelon monkeys, which are harder to destroy
      * Settling computation to determine end of turn
  * Next up:

  * Brief look at article on the [http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/physics-of-angry-birds/ Physics of Angry Birds]
  * *Lecture*: QUnit -- the !JavaScript Unit Testing Framework

== October 19 ==

  * Standup
    * Completed
      * Alex created a new cannon, new banana, and a collection of demo monkey sprites
      * Progress on switching from launcher module to launcher "type" (pending commit)
      * Win condition
      * Monkeys and fortress pieces destroyed when knocked off screen
    * Next up: 
      * Bug fixes
  * Bugs identified:
    * Camera follows projectile, making damage animation occur off screen
    * Rendering problem occurs sometimes
    * Projectiles don't hurt the monkeys. The effect is hilarious as hitting monkeys can make them fly hundreds of meters through the air.... but it isn't realistic.
    * We'd like the cannon wheels stationary
  * Also had a class-long brainstorming session for project next steps.  Very productive.
  * *Lecture and Discussion* on Ben Cherry's blog article on [http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/7/Writing-Testable-JavaScript writing testable JavaScript]

      * Projectile launch point
      * Initial sound integration (callbacks will occur later)

      * Some progress on level editor
